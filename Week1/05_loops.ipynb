    "\n",
    "2.  Temperature Conversion:  You have a list of temperatures in Celsius: `celsius_temps = [ -10, 0, 25, 100, 500 ]`. Use a `for` loop to convert each temperature to Fahrenheit and print the result. The formula is:  `Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Exoplanet Distance:  Simulate the distance of an exoplanet from its star, increasing by 0.1 AU in each step.  Use a `while` loop to stop the simulation when the distance reaches 2.0 AU. Print the distance at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Prime Number Checker: Write a code that checks if a number is Prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Fibonacci Sequence: Write a code that Prints the Fibonacci Sequence until a limit. For more on Fibonacci, see this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-program-to-print-the-fibonacci-sequence/)."
