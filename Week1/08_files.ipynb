    "As astronomers, we deal with vast amounts of data, from telescope images to catalogs of millions of stars. This data is often stored in files, and it's essential to know how to read, write, and manipulate these files programmatically. Furthermore, errors are inevitable when working with data and code, and understanding how to handle them gracefully is crucial for writing robust and reliable astronomical software.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the basics of file input/output (I/O) and error handling in Python, equipping you with the skills to process data, manage potential problems, and build more resilient astronomical tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Understand the concept of file I/O (input/output).\n",
    "*   Open files for reading, writing, and appending.\n",
    "*   Read data from files line by line or as a whole.\n",
    "*   Write data to files.\n",
    "*   Handle common file-related errors.\n",
    "*   Understand the concept of exceptions.\n",
    "*   Use `try...except` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "*   Implement `finally` blocks for cleanup operations.\n",
    "*   Raise custom exceptions to signal specific error conditions.\n",

    "**Key Terms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **File I/O:** The process of reading data from and writing data to files.\n",
    "*   **File Handle:** A reference to an open file, allowing you to perform operations on it.\n",
    "*   **Exception:** An event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. It represents an error condition.\n",
    "*   **Error Handling:** The process of detecting and responding to exceptions to prevent program crashes and ensure data integrity.\n",
    "*   `try...except`: A block of code that allows you to attempt an operation that might raise an exception and handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "*   `finally`: A block of code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is used for cleanup operations (e.g., closing files).\n",
    "*   `with open():` A recommended way to open files. It assures the file is closed."

    "## Opening Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, working with files is a fundamental task. Before you can read from or write to a file, you must first *open* it. Opening a file creates a connection between your Python program and the file on your computer's file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `open()` Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to opening files is the `open()` function. It takes two main arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`filename`:** The path to the file you want to open. This can be a relative path (relative to the current working directory) or an absolute path. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `\"my_data.txt\"` (relative path: in the same folder as your Python script)\n",
    "    *   `\"data/star_catalog.csv\"` (relative path: in a subfolder named \"data\")\n",
    "    *   `\"/home/user/documents/observational_data.fits\"` (absolute path: specifies the exact location on the system; *nix based systems example*)\n",
    "    *   `\"C:\\\\Users\\\\MyUser\\\\Documents\\\\data.txt\"` (absolute path on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`mode`:** A string that specifies how you want to use the file. The most common modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `\"r\"`: **Read mode**. Opens the file for reading. This is the default mode if you don't specify one. You can only read data from the file. If the file doesn't exist, a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised.\n",
    "    *   `\"w\"`: **Write mode**. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its contents will be *overwritten* (all existing data will be lost!). If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created. Use this mode with caution.\n",
    "    *   `\"a\"`: **Append mode**. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, new data will be added to the *end* of the file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created. This mode is useful for adding data to an existing file without erasing its contents.\n",
    "    *   `\"x\"`: **Exclusive Creation mode**. Creates a new file for writing. If the file already exists, it will raise a `FileExistsError`.\n",
    "    *   `\"b\"`: **Binary mode**. Opens the file in binary mode.\n",
    "    *   `\"t\"`: **Text mode**. Opens the file in text mode (default).\n",
    "    *   `\"+\"`: **Updating mode**. Opens the file for updating (reading and writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file_handle = open(\"star_catalog.txt\", \"r\") # Open the file in read mode\n",
