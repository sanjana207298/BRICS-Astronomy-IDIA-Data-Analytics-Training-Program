    "\n",
    "This lecture introduces the basic concepts of Python variables and data types. It also highlights their applications in astronomy. This will serve as the foundation for the follow up topics in dealing with astronomy data, as variables allow you to store and manipulate information, while data types define the kind of operations you can perform on this information. This lecture will guide you through variable assignment, naming conventions, and the various data types available in Python, providing practical examples relevant to Astronomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define and use variables in Python, adhering to best practices for naming and assignment.\n",
    "- Identify and utilize various Python data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.\n",
    "- Understand how data types are used in the context of astronomy data, such as coordinates and attribute information.\n",
    "- Perform basic operations and manipulations on different data types, reinforcing your understanding of their practical applications in astronomy and data science in general.\n",
    "- Apply the concepts of variables and data types in solving real-world  problems, including that of astronomy."

    "\n",
    "- Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, such as `_`.\n",
    "- The remainder of the variable name can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive, so `star_name` and `Star_Name` are different variables.\n",
    "- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful, such as `star_name` instead of `sn`.\n",
    "- Avoid using Python keywords and built-in functions as variable names, such as `print`, `sum`, `list`, `dict`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `set`, `tuple`, `range`, `type`, `object`, `None`, `True`, `False`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `if`, `else`, `elif`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, `def`, `return`, `lambda`, `class`, `import`, `from`, `as`, `with`, `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`, `assert`, `del`, `in`, `is`, `global`, `nonlocal`, `yield`, `async`, `await`."

    "3.  If you have a variable `star_temp = 5500`, how would you change its value to `6000`?\n",
    "4.  How would you create a variable named `is_gas_giant` and set it to `True` (representing that Jupiter is a gas giant)?\n",
    "5.  If you have the variable `moon_count = 2`, how would you print a message like: \"Mars has 2 moons.\" using this variable?\n",
    "6.  Is `Number Of Stars` a good variable name in Python? Why or why not?\n",
    "7.  How would you create a variable called `galaxy_type` and store the text \"Spiral\" in it?\n",

    "**Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Subtraction: Earth is 1.0 AU from the Sun, Mars is 1.52 AU. How would you calculate the difference between Mars's distance and Earth's distance using the subtraction operator (`-`)?\n",
    "2.  Multiplication: Jupiter's orbit takes 11.86 Earth years. An Earth year is 365.25 days. How would you calculate Jupiter's orbital period in days using the multiplication operator (`*`)?\n",
    "3.  Assignment (`+=`): If a variable `jupiter_moons` currently holds the value `79`, how would you use the `+=` operator to add `3` more moons to it?\n",
    "4.  Comparison (`>`): Venus's temperature is `462` degrees, Earth's is `15`. How would you check if Venus's temperature is greater than Earth's using the `>` operator? (What is the result?)\n",
    "5.  Comparison (`==`): If you have a variable `galaxy_type = \"Spiral\"`, how would you check if its value is exactly equal to `\"Elliptical\"` using the `==` operator? (What is the result?)\n",
    "6.  Logical (`and`): A planet needs `has_water = True` AND `atmosphere_ok = False` to be habitable (simple rule). How would you use the `and` operator to see if *both* conditions are met? (What is the result?)\n",
    "7.  Logical (`or`): Observing is possible if `is_night = True` OR `is_solar_telescope = False`. How would you use the `or` operator to see if *at least one* of these conditions is met? (What is the result?)\n",
    "8.  Multiple Arithmetic: Proxima Centauri is `4.24` light-years away (`distance_ly`). One light-year is `9.461e12` km (`km_per_ly`). How would you first calculate the total distance in km (`distance_km`) and then print it?"
